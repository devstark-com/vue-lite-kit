# vue-lite-kit

There are a lot of awesome products like Element, Buefy, Quasar which provide a bunch of UI components to build beautiful Vue apps. But all of them have own styles from the box. They perfectly fit if you gonna use them as is and without any redesign. But if you'll try to use some of them in a project with a custom design you'll have to spend a lot of time on overriding it native styles.

Actually, this package provides the same - bunch of UI components, but all of them are easily restyleable or can be style-agnostic at all. Also, we implement API of each component our own way trying to pick the best features and abilities in order to build really flexible UI kit which can be easily used in any project with the custom design.
